Description: SPARKI (Statistical Process Aimed at Robust Kraken 2 Interpretation, <sparki>) was developed as both an R package and a command line tool to help researchers interpret the outputs of Kraken 2 (Wood et al. 2019). It is available both as a standalone software and as part of an end-to-end pathogen identification pipeline (sparki-nf, <sparki-nf>). The main sample-level results yielded by SPARKI are, for each taxon, (i) the proportion of minimisers found in the sample (the higher the proportion of minimisers, the more of the organismâ€™s genome is likely present in the sample) and (ii) the statistical significance of the result.
